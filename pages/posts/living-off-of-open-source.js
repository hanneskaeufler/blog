  content: `For the second year in a row now I have participated in *Hacktoberfest*, an open-source initiative by [DigitalOcean](https://digitalocean.com), a cloud infrastructure provider. What's the deal? You, fellow open-source contributor, just have to open a handful of pull-request during the timeframe of October 1st to 31st. DigitalOcean will be generous and send you a limited edition t-shirt for free (well, for your time spent on those 5 pull-requests that is). Here's the two shirts I got for my 2016 and 2017 efforts:

Needless to say, I find that an awesome initiative, seeing that the world builds upon open-source software. The five pull-requests that got me my t-shirt this year were:
* [Increase test coverage on administrate](https://github.com/thoughtbot/administrate/pull/1000)
* [Improve german translation on administrate](https://github.com/thoughtbot/administrate/pull/1002)
* [Add unit tests for previously uncovered code in a laravel caching lib](https://github.com/GeneaLabs/laravel-model-caching/pull/18)
* [Improve modularity of code in solar-system game](https://github.com/Zac-Garby/solar-system/pull/33)
* [Add hover effect in play button](https://github.com/Zac-Garby/solar-system/pull/53)

To finish this off I can't recommend participating in Hacktoberfest enough, and thanks to DigitalOcean to appreciate this by giving you a t-shirt.`,
