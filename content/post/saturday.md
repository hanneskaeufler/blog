Today is a saturday. It's a slow day. I barely got up, cooked & ate, binge-watched a ton of tv series. "Fear the Walking Dead" is off of my watchlist after the pilot already. To not waste this day completely, the plan was to finally launch a site where visitors can vote on their preferred tests. Tests as in software tests, so code to verify the correctness of a piece of a computer program.
