+++
Chrome and Safari are both great browsers. They each have their Pros and Cons. I tend to be undecided on which one I like better.
Chrome has great [developer tools](https://developer.chrome.com/devtools). I never really got warm with Safari's. As usual, Safari is tightly integrated
with OS X. Tab sync so iOS's Safari being one of them. Generally using less memory. So lately I tend to use Safari more then Chrome. But out of old habits
I often start a new window in Chrome and browse for a few minutes before remembering that I wanted to use Safari. So here it is, the solution ~~to all of my problems~~
to a tiny annoyance of my blessed life:

This will take all of your windows and tabs you currently have open in Google Chrome, and replicate them in Safari. Switch browsers with the touch of a button.
