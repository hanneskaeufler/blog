Today is a saturday. It's a slow day. I barely got up, cooked & ate, binge-watched a ton of tv series. ["Fear the Walking Dead"](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3743822/?ref_=nv_sr_1) is off of my watchlist after the pilot already. To not waste this day completely, the plan was to finally launch a site where visitors can vote on their preferred tests. Tests as in software tests, so code to verify the correctness of a piece of a computer program. However, after diving deep into [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org) again, I saw this super epic tweet:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="de"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The best practice is shipping.</p>&mdash; Ryan Florence (@ryanflorence) <a href="https://twitter.com/ryanflorence/status/723918632913264640">23. April 2016</a></blockquote> <script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

This got me thinking. Instead of getting hung up on building from scratch something that would be a blog for the most part, I should really focus on "shipping". That's why, for the n-th time, I stopped working on the site codenamed "writing-better-tests". Instead I set foot into the world of static site generators, fired up this thing called [Hugo](http://gohugo.io), and wrote these lines.

As for the future of this page, we will have to wait and see. I would love to continuosly add new content, mainly on the topic of software development. I do have a post or two in my mind already, so stay tuned ...
